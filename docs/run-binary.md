Run Bubble from a Binary Distribution
=====================================
The setup instructions below assume you are running Ubuntu 20.04 or Mac OS X.

If you're running another flavor of Linux, you can probably figure out how to get things working.

If you're running Windows, things might be more difficult.

## Download a Bubble Distribution
Download the [latest Bubble release](https://jenkins.bubblev.org/public/releases/bubble/latest/bubble.zip)

Open a command-line terminal.

Unzip the file that you downloaded:

    unzip bubble.zip

Change directories into the directory containing the files that were unzipped:

    cd bubble-Adventure_1.x.x     # replace `Adventure_1.x.x` with the version that you downloaded

## One-Time System Setup
You'll need to install some software for Bubble to work correctly.

Follow the instructions in [System Software Setup](system-software.md) to install the required software. 

## Run Bubble
Continue by running your Bubble as a [Local Launcher](local-launcher.md).
