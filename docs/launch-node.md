# Bubble Node Mode
A Bubble in Node Mode is a proper Bubble that allows you to connect your devices to it, and manages network traffic
on behalf of those devices.

Launching a Bubble in Node Mode requires a Bubble in Remote Launcher Mode. If you don't have
a Bubble in Remote Launcher Mode, go back and follow the [Remote Launcher Mode instructions](remote-launcher.md).

## Create a user
Load your Remote Launcher's home page in a web browser.

Click the "Sign Up" button in the header to create a new user account.

Note: You *could* sign in using the root account and launch a Bubble from there, but this is discouraged for security reasons.
It is *highly recommended* to launch new Bubbles using a regular user account, and not your Remote Launcher root account.
You should use the root account on the Remote Launcher only to manage the system itself.

## Verify user
After you create a user, the Remote Launcher will send an email with a verification link.
Click the link in the email to verify your new account.

## Launch Bubble
After you click the verification link, you should see a "Launch Bubble" screen.

Choose your configuration options, then click the "Launch Your Bubble!" button kick things off.

The screen will refresh and show a progress meter.

While your Bubble is launching, take a moment to
[install the Bubble Native app](https://support.getbubblenow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050801634-Connect-a-device-to-your-Bubble)
on each device you plan on connecting to your Bubble.

When your Bubble finishes launching, it will show a "Connect to Bubble" button. Click this and you'll be connected
to your Bubble Node.

## Connect Devices
[Install the Bubble Native app](https://support.getbubblenow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050801634-Connect-a-device-to-your-Bubble)
on each device you plan on connecting to your Bubble.

Start the app. At the bottom of the login screen, you should see "Running your own Bubble? Set Launcher".

Click or tap "Set Launcher" and enter the hostname of your Remote Launcher.

Then fill out the "Email" and "Password" fields, and click or tap the "Sign In" button.
Your Bubble should automatically connect and configure the device. If it does not, click or tap the "Connect" button.
