# Bubble Node Mode
A Bubble in Node Mode is a proper Bubble that allows you to connect your devices to it, and manages network traffic
on behalf of those devices.

Launching a Bubble in Node Mode requires a Bubble in Local or Remote Launcher Mode. If you don't have
a Bubble in Local or Remote Launcher Mode, go back and follow the [Local Launcher Mode instructions](local-launcher.md)
and/or the [Remote Launcher Mode instructions](remote-launcher.md).

Load your Launcher's home page in a web browser.

## From a Remote Launcher
If you're launching from a [Remote Launcher](remote-launcher.md), follow [these instructions](launch-node-from-remote.md)

## From a Local Launcher
If you're launching from a [Local Launcher](local-launcher.md), follow [these instructions](launch-node-from-local.md)

## Connect Devices
[Install the Bubble Native app](https://support.getbubblenow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050801634-Connect-a-device-to-your-Bubble)
on each device you plan on connecting to your Bubble.

Start the app. At the bottom of the login screen, you should see "Running your own Bubble? Set Launcher".

Click or tap "Set Launcher" and enter the hostname of your new Bubble Node.

Then fill out the "Email" and "Password" fields, and click or tap the "Sign In" button.
Your Bubble should automatically connect and configure the device. If it does not, click or tap the "Connect" button.
