Launching a Bubble from a Remote Launcher
=========================================
These instructions assume you have already set up a [Remote Launcher](remote-launcher.md).

## Create a user
Click the "Sign Up" button in the header to create a new user account.

Note: You *could* sign in using the root account and launch a Bubble from there, but this is discouraged for security reasons.
It is *highly recommended* to launch new Bubbles using a regular user account, and not your Remote Launcher root account.
You should use the root account on the Remote Launcher only to manage the system itself.

## Verify user
After you create a user, the Remote Launcher will send an email with a verification link.
Click the link in the email to verify your new account.

## Launch Bubble
After you click the verification link, you should see a "Launch Bubble" screen.

Choose your configuration options, then click the "Launch Your Bubble!" button kick things off.

The screen will refresh and show a progress meter. A typical launch will take about 10 minutes.

## Your Very First Bubble
The very first Bubble you launch will use a [packer image](packer.md) that was created
during [activation](activation.md).

If the image is still being built or needs to be built, that will add some time to the launch process.

The [Bubble packer documentation](packer.md) has more details on this process. 

## Install Bubble Apps
While your Bubble is launching, take a moment to
[install the Bubble Native app](https://support.getbubblenow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050801634-Connect-a-device-to-your-Bubble)
on each device you plan on connecting to your Bubble.

When your Bubble finishes launching, it will show a "Connect to Bubble" button. Click this and you'll be connected
to your Bubble Node.
