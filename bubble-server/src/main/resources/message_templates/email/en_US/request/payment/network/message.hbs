Hello {{account.name}},

Your Bubble is running, but a recent bill could not be paid.

Please check your payment information and pay your bill:

  {{configuration.publicUriBase}}/me/plans/{{message.data}}/bills

If your bill remains unpaid for 5+ days, your Bubble will be automatically stopped.

NOTE: If you haven't downloaded your Bubble's restore key, you will NOT be able to restore your Bubble
after it has been stopped. You would have to set up a new Bubble.

Thank you for using Bubble!
