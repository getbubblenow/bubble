Hello {{account.name}},

Congratulations, your new Bubble is launching. It typically takes about 20 minutes to set itself up.

When your Bubble has finished its self-setup process, it will send you a message with a link to unlock it.

You'll need to install the WireGuard application on each device that will connect to your Bubble.

While you're waiting for your Bubble to be ready, go ahead and install the WireGuard application on each
device you will connect to your Bubble.

Instruction for installing WireGuard can be found here: https://github.com/bubblev/bubble-docs/blob/master/wg_setup/README.md

If you have any difficulties installing WireGuard or using your new Bubble, please contact support@bubblev.com

Thank you for using Bubble!
