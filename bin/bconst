# Write a constant value to stdout.
#
# This will only ever write the constant value to stdout if it can successfully be read.
# If the constant can be read, its value is printed with the .toString() method.
# If an error occurs, nothing is written to stdout, and the error will be written to stderr.
# If the value of the constant is null, nothing is printed to stdout, and "null" is printed to stderr.
#
# Usage:
#
#     bconst classAndMember
#
#   classAndMember   : the full name of a Java class, followed by a dot and the constant member name
#
# For example:
#
#     bconst bubble.ApiConstants.ROOT_NETWORK_UUID
