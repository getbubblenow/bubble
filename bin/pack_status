# Display active and completed packer jobs
#
# Usage:
#
#   pack_status [running|completed]
#
# If the first argument is 'running' then only the status of running jobs will be shown
# If the first argument is 'completed' then only the status of completed jobs will be shown
#
# Based on your BUBBLE_USER, BUBBLE_PASS and BUBBLE_API environment variables, this command will
# use the bubble API to display the current status of the PackerService
#
# It returns a JSON object in the form:
# {
#   "running": [
#     {...job1...},
#     {...job2...},
#     ...
#   ],
#   "completed": {
#     "cloud_key1": [ {...image1...}, {...image2...}, ... ],
#     "cloud_key2": [ {...image1...}, {...image2...}, ... ],
#     ...
#   }
# }
#
# In the above, "running" is an array of job summary objects
# and "completed" is a key/value map where they key indicates a cloud,
# and the value is an array of packer images that have completed
#
# If you pass the 'running' argument, only the array of running jobs will be printed
# If you pass the 'completed' argument, only the map of cloud->image[] will be printed
